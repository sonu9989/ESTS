# Estimating Subsidence Trend and Seasonality (ESTS)


#### Seasonality and trend decomposition of subsidence and groundwater

Decomposition time series decomposition of the hydraulic head (h) & deformation (s) based on STD


#### Modeling the non-trend dataset between subsidence and groundwater

Non-trend Modelâ€¦estimation of non-trend subsidence () using Random Forest 

#### Estimated subsidence change based on groundwater change

Trend Estimator estimation of subsidence change () using GWR
