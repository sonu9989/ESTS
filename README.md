# Estimation of Subsidence Trend and Seasonality (ESTS)


## 1. Seasonality and trend decomposition of subsidence and groundwater

**Decomposition.py**: - time series decomposition of hydraulic head (h) & deformation (s) based on S


## 2. Modeling the non-trend dataset of subsidence and groundwater

**Non-trend Model.ipynb**: -  estimation of non-trend subsidence (s<sub>non-trend</sub>) using Random Forest (RF) 

## 3. Estimated subsidence change based on groundwater change
